## Method and 

I decided to work with shadcn/ui to make development faster, also since the given figma file used its components.

By using shadcns components the different parts were a bit easier to break out. The idea was to make an SPA 
which would use state to trigger conditional rendering in the three main components. 

* UI Changes 
    - Made header button and header title larger to prevent squinting eyes.


I did my best despite being sat with a cold and think I could do better if I would have had a more frequent coding habit. Despite using shadcn for the first time I found pretty easy and intuitive. The idea was to make a timer from the progessbar but I ran out of time. I had some issues with the font not being loaded properly but managed to sort it out be cross checking the shadcn documentation.
